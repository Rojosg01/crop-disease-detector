Smart Crop Disease DetectorAn AI-powered agricultural assistant providing instant, localized, and conversational support for farmers.**1. IntroductionIn regions like Meghalaya, India, agriculture is the cornerstone of the economy. However, the unique climate, marked by high rainfall and humidity, creates a fertile ground for crop diseases. Farmers often lack immediate access to expert advice, leading to significant crop loss and the inefficient use of costly pesticides.This project, the Smart Crop Disease Detector, is a web-based tool designed to bridge this gap. It provides farmers with an instant, accurate diagnosis from a simple photograph of a leaf and offers sustainable, eco-friendly treatment plans tailored to their specific location.2. Key Featuresüå± Instant AI-Powered Diagnosis: Leverages Google's state-of-the-art Gemini model to identify a wide range of crop diseases and pests from a single image.üìç Hyper-Localized Advice: This is the core innovation. By providing a location (e.g., "Khanapara, Meghalaya"), the treatment advice is customized to the local climate, soil conditions, and commonly available resources.üí¨ "Ask the Expert" Conversational AI: After receiving a diagnosis, farmers can ask follow-up questions in a natural chat conversation to get deeper insights and clarifications.üì± Mobile-First & Responsive Design: The user interface is clean, simple, and designed to work seamlessly on any device, especially mobile phones, which are most accessible to farmers in the field.‚ôªÔ∏è Focus on Sustainability: The AI is prompted to prioritize organic, eco-friendly, and sustainable treatment options, reducing reliance on chemical pesticides.3.
